## Overview

This project is designed to simulate chat interactions with extensible types and methods. It is structured as a Haskell package, following best practices for library and executable separation, documentation, and test coverage.

## Features

- Modular Haskell codebase (`src/`)
- Executable for running chat simulations (`app/`)
- Test suite for verifying functionality (`test/`)
- Haddock-generated documentation
- Strict warning and compatibility flags for robust code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [GHC (The Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/naman-sriv/Chat_Simulation.git
    cd Chat_Simulation/Chat-Simulation
    ```

2. Build dependencies:
    ```sh
    stack setup
    stack build
    ```

## Building & Running

To build the project and run the main chat simulation executable:

```sh
stack build
stack exec Chat-Simulation-exe
```

## Testing

Run all tests using Stack:

```sh
stack test
```

## Documentation

- Source code is documented with Haddock.
- To generate API docs locally:
    ```sh
    stack haddock
    ```
- Pre-generated documentation may be available in the `haddock docs/` directory.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

- Open issues for bugs, features, or questions.
- Submit pull requests for code, documentation, or tests.
- Follow the repository’s code style and write tests for new features.
